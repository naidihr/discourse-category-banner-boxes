This fork incudes the following modifications:

* The category banner box is displayed in-line above the main heading instead of full width at the top. This allows for display a banner theme at the top, for eaxmple the discourse versatile banner.
* The category banner box is displayed in the same style as the discourse subcategory boxes, which are a core component of discousre. These subcategory baxes are a display option in the dicourse category settings *Show subcategory list above topics in this category*. This option displays the subcategory category name and description as a row or box above the topic list, using the category background colour as the left border. 
* If the category is a subcategory, the category name is displayed as follows - **Parent category name: Subcategory name**
