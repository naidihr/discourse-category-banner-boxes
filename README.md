This is a fork of discourse-category-banners by @awesomerobot Kris

This fork incudes the following modifications:

* The category banner box is displayed in-line above the main heading instead of full width at the top. This allows for display a banner theme at the top, for example the discourse-versatile-banner.

* The category banner box is displayed in the same style as the native discourse subcategory boxes, which are a core component of discourse. These subcategory boxes are a display option in the discourse category settings Show subcategory list above topics in this category . This option displays the subcategory category name and description as a row or box above the topic list, using the category background colour as the left border.

* If the category is a subcategory, the category name is displayed as breadcrumb as follows - Parent category name: Subcategory name
